Hi, I am Utkarsh Thanvi, a junior at BITS Pilani studying EEE.
I play the guitar, and am the current secretary of Music Club BITS Pilani.

Recently, I've been: 
- working on a [helix to zed theme porter](https://github.com/utshaan/hxzedtc)

- learning **Rust**, and trying not to procastinate everyday

I'm also into alot of different genres of music, but don't even try to suggest me EDM.
